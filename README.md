# Three-Tier Application Overview
=====================================

This project consists of a comprehensive three-tier application, comprising a Backend, Database, and Proxy, each serving a distinct purpose.

## Component Breakdown
-----------------------

### Backend

* **Purpose:** The application logic layer, implemented in Go, responsible for connecting to the database and processing data.
* **Files:**
	+ `main.go`: The Go application code that handles the database connection and data retrieval.
	+ `Dockerfile`: A multi-stage Dockerfile used to build and run the Go application inside a container.

### Database

* **Purpose:** The data layer, using PostgreSQL, stores persistent data.
* **Configuration:**
	+ `docker-compose.yml`: The database is configured using environment variables like `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, and `POSTGRES_DB`, which are specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Proxy

* **Purpose:** The intermediary, implemented using Nginx, forwards client requests to the backend, providing an HTTPS endpoint and potential security features.
* **Files:**
	+ `nginx.conf`: The configuration file for Nginx that sets up the server to listen on port 443 (HTTPS) and forward requests to the backend service.

### Docker Compose

* **Purpose:** Orchestrates the deployment of all services, managing how they interact, and making it easy to start/stop the entire application stack with a single command.
* **File:**
	+ `docker-compose.yml`: Defines and manages all the services (backend, database, proxy) and their respective configurations, such as networks, volumes, and build instructions.

## Key Benefits
---------------

* **Consistency:** Docker Compose ensures that the application runs consistently across different environments.
* **Scalability:** The setup is scalable, allowing for easy addition or removal of services as needed.
* **Portability:** The application is portable, as all dependencies and configurations are encapsulated within containers.
* **Simplified Development and Deployment:** Docker Compose simplifies development and deployment workflows, making it easy to manage the entire application stack.
